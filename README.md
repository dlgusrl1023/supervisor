# Saseul Supervisor

Version: 0.5

## About

Supervisors are nodes that sync all existing blocks on the network.

They differ from light nodes because they are meant to monitor and supervise 
the blockchain network. The supervisors check whether the network has generated 
a valid block and store the block if they are valid. 
They are capable of detecting erroneous hash values but they do not directly 
form transactions that confirm the error or punish the evil nodes.

## Note

Additional source code will be released after internal policy decisions have been made.
